# Sales_Analysis
This is my first project on Data Analysis where I have used Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to answer the business questions asked by the owner.
### Questions
1.  What was the best month for sale? How much was earned that month?
2.  Which city has the highest number of Sales?
3.  What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers buying products?
4.   What products are most often sold together?
5.   What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
