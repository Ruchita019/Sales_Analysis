# Sales_Analysis
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am excited to share my first project on Data Analysis, where I utilized Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to address the business questions posed by the owner.

### Analysis Process
To tackle the project, I followed a structured analysis process consisting of the following steps:

1. Question or problem definitions: I clearly defined the questions and problems I aimed to solve using the provided dataset.
2. Collection of data from reliable sources: I obtained the necessary data from trustworthy sources to ensure the accuracy and reliability of my analysis.
3. Cleaning and preparing data: I cleaned and prepared the data, transforming it into a usable form by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and performing 
any necessary data manipulations.
4. Analyze and explore the data: I performed a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, applying exploratory data analysis methods to extract meaningful insights.
5. Visualize, report, and present the final solutions: I employed data visualization techniques to effectively communicate the results and findings of my analysis. I presented the solutions in a clear and concise manner to enhance understanding and facilitate decision-making.

### Key Questions Explored
During this project, I addressed the following key questions:

1. What was the best month for sales, and how much revenue was generated?
2. Which city had the highest number of sales?
3. What is the optimal time for displaying advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers making purchases?
4. Which products are frequently sold together?
5. Which product had the highest sales volume? What factors do you think contributed to its success?

By answering these questions, I aimed to provide valuable insights that can assist in making informed business decisions and optimizing sales strategies.
