# Sales_Analysis
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am excited to share my first project on Data Analysis, where I utilized Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to address the business questions posed by the owner.


### Analysis Process
To tackle the project, I followed a structured analysis process consisting of the following steps:

1. Question or problem definitions
2. Collection of data from reliable sources
3. Cleaning and preparing data
4. Analyzing and exploring the data
5. Visualizing, reporting, and presenting the final solutions.


### Key Questions Explored
During this project, I addressed the following key questions:

1. What was the best month for sales, and how much revenue was generated?
2. Which city had the highest number of sales?
3. What is the optimal time for displaying advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers making purchases?
4. Which products are frequently sold together?
5. Which product had the highest sales volume? What factors do you think contributed to its success?


By answering these questions, I aimed to provide valuable insights that can assist in making informed business decisions and optimizing sales strategies.
